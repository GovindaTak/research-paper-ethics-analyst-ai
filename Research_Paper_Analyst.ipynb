            "- **Methodological Focus**: Similar to image data, the focus was on data synthesis, with many articles only providing general ethical discussions.\n",
            "- **Privacy and Bias**: A substantial number of articles aimed to resolve privacy issues and reduce bias, but explicit discussions on trust, transparency, and moral considerations were lacking.\n",
            "- **Limited Ethical Framework**: Only a few articles discussed the ethical implications of generative AI in structured data, with minimal exploration of equity or data security issues.\n",

            "The systematic review underscores the necessity for a structured approach to ethical discussions in generative AI applications within healthcare. The proposed ethics checklist aims to bridge existing gaps and enhance the ethical discourse surrounding these technologies, ultimately fostering trust and accountability in their deployment.\n",
